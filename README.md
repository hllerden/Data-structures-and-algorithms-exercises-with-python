# Sorting Algorithms runtime analysis

  1.  Selection Sort
  2.  Merge Sort
  3.  Quick Sort
  
  
  I chose an array with 9900 elements to better see the difference between the sorting algorithms.
  
  ### 1.  Selection Sort
   `Selection short run time:   --- %s seconds --- 4.949764966964722`
   
  ### 2.  Merge Sort
   `Merge function run time --- %s seconds --- 0.04997706413269043`
  
  ### 3.  Quick Sort
   `QuickShort function run time --- %s seconds --- 0.023398399353027344`
